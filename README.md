# What is this project?

This project was a mobile prototype made during CodeHack 2020 by Team Dudley Do-Right. Team Dudley Do-Right ended up winning 2nd place and the People's Choice award as a result of their idea on revolutionizing the volunteering scene in health care. This prototype served as a great demo into their vision. We named our application prototype `IslandHealthVolunteering`.

Our team consisted of 3 builders [Ahmed Siddiqui](https://github.com/AhmedNSidd), [David Schriemer](https://github.com/DSchriemer), and [Shreyas Devalapurkar](https://github.com/sdevalapurkar) who were responsible for colloboratively creating the prototype, gathering requirements for the application, and ensuring solid communication between the development side of the project and the rest of the team.
